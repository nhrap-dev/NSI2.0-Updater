Skip to step 7 if you already have the NSI2.0 CSV files generated.

1. Obtain NSI 2.0 shapefiles or gpkg

2a Using Arcmap, merge all shapefiles into one shapefile or featureclass in a fgdb, for each state/territory.

2b Using Arcmap, export the main.nsi table to a csv.

3a Using Arcmap, selecting all records in the merged shapefile or featureclass from the previous step and export to a text file (CSV). You can delete the NSI 2.0 merged shapefile or featureclass at this point.

4. Open the Python script with a text editor or Python Editor and modify the following:
	a) inputCsvPath = the file path to the csv you created in the previous step, i.e. 'C:/temp/15/HI15.txt'
	b) database = the sql server database name, ie 'HI' for Hawaii (watch out for 'AS' and sql reserved words, untested as of 2020-2-9)
	c) outputCsvPath = the file path where you want the output csv fiel to be, i.e. 'C:/temp/NSI2_HI_20200209.csv'

5. Run the python script with a Python editor, i.e. IDLE so you can watch for any errors.

6. Once successfully run you can review the output csv file using excel or importing to arcmap as xy data.

7. Use SQL SERVER IMPORT AND EXPORT DATA tool to import the csv to the [XX].[dbo].[tsNsiGbs] table, where XX is the State or Territory database, i.e. 'HI' for Hawaii.

	a) screenshots of import, include truncate table
